A Deliberative Project for the Advancement of Water Systems Simulation

# Project Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this project is to collaboratively plot a course for development of a hydraulic solution engine worthy of carying on the legacy of EPANET. This project's scope is limited to design and development of a hydraulic and water quality solution engine, extended-period simulation capabilities, and I/O extensions to provide backwards compatibility with EPANET files and assets. The development of extended features, GUIs, and derivative tools is meant to be enabled by the work done here, but is out of scope for this project.

# Project Status / Getting Involved
We are in the early stages of needs-assessment and a survey of design considerations. The best place to get involved is in this repo's issues. If you have concrete design suggestions, make them there, discuss, and open a PR to `master` with your contribution to the design documents.
